# My custom config for tmux

## Installation
Firstly, ensure Tmux is installed.
Then, clone the Packer repository somewhere via the terminal command.

> Unix, Linux Installation
```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/KadyrPoyraz/tmux-config.git ~/.config/tmux
```
This command will clone this repo into the `~/.config/tmux directory`, which automatically sets this repo as your Tmux config.
